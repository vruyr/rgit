TODO:
	☐	Add support for `git-worktree`s.
	☐	Implement routines to deep compare two ".git" repositories for equality – all the objects, all refs, all config values, and all other unknown files. Use exclusion principle.
	☐	Add a command that will run `git clean -Xdf -- {all files of a named ignore group}`. Make that part of the configuration file to eliminate accidental deletion of imporant ignored files because of wrong command line arguments.
	☐	Implement a check of for submodules to be fully pushed.
	☐	scan should look for and report repositories sitting inside other repositories that are not proper submodules – not committed, committed but not in .gitmodules.
	☐	status should report submodules that does not exist in the remote specified in .gitmodules file.
	☐	transplant – a new command that places a repository from specified url into specified folder and if the folder is empty checks out the specified ref
		$ rgit transplant sync://vruyr/config/home.git --branch master --git-dir ~/.xgit/home --worktree ~
	☐	release – a new command that checks the status of a repo and deletes it if it's clean and all of ignored files are included in the command line whitelist.
	☐	rgit behind: show all repositories where the remote has been updated @created(2019-01-06T16:58:49-0500)
	☐	rgit find-object "$object_id": git -C "$repo" cat-file -e "$object_id" 2>/dev/null && echo "$repo" @created(2019-01-06T16:58:49-0500)
	☐	rgit tree ~: Show the filesystem content excluding any tracked files and folders. @created(2019-01-06T16:58:49-0500)
	☐	rgit purge ~: `git uninit.sh` all repositories gitdir or worktree of which is in provided paths @created(2019-01-06T16:58:49-0500)
	☐	Implement all features to be available for a remote machine though ssh. @created(2020-01-14T10:10:22-0500)
	☐	The `ignored` command crashes with an exception if a repo or worktree does not exist. @created(2020-05-02T09:37:16-0400)
	☐	The parameter `ignroed` command takes should not filter out entire worktrees but rather individual paths across all repositories' worktrees. @created(2020-05-02T09:52:40-0400)
	☐	Implement support for negative fetch and push refspecs (since git 2.29.0) @created(2020-12-13T13:20:34-0500)
